## Average Value Function
 - The average value of a continuous function $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$ is given by: $$f_{avg}=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)dx$$

## Area between Two Curves
 - There are two cases:
	1. Determine the area between $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, where $f(x) \ge g(x)$. The formula is: $$\int_a^b[f(x)-g(x)]dx$$
	2. Determine the area between $x=f(y)$ and $x=g(y)$, where $f(y) \ge g(y)$. The formula is: $$A = \int_a^b[f(y)-g(y)]dy$$
 - In the first case, $f(x)$ is the upper function, and $g(x)$ is the lower function, while in the second case, $f'(y)$ is the right function, and $g(y)$ is the left function

## Work
 - In early physics lectures, we look at work that a constant force does over a distance, and the equation for this is $W=Fd$
 - However, sometimes, the force will not be constant
 - Then, the work done by the force in moving an object from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is given by: $$W=\int_a^bF(x)dx$$
