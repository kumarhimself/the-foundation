## Indefinite Integrals
 - Given a function $F(x)$, the anti-derivative of $F(x)$ is any function $f(x)$ such that: $$f'(x)=F(x)$$
 - If $f(x)$ is any anti-derivative of $F(x)$, then the most general anti-derivative of $F(x)$ is called an indefinite integral, which is denoted as: $$\int F(x)dx = f(x) + c$$
 - In the definition, $\int$ is called the integral symbol, $F(x)$ is the integrand, and c is called the constant of integration
 - The differential is placed after the intergrand to tell us the following:
	1. Which variable to integrate
	2. What to integrate (whatever is in between the integral sign and the differential)

### Properties
$$\int kf(x)dx = k\int f(x)dx$$
$$\int -f(x)dx = -\int f(x)dx$$
$$\int [f(x) \pm g(x)]dx = \int f(x)dx \pm \int g(x)dx$$

## Computing Indefinite Integrals
$$\int x^{n}dx=\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c, n \ne -1$$
$$\int kdx = kx + c$$
### Integrals of Trigonometric Functions
 - $\int sin(x)dx = -cos(x)+c$
 - $\int cos(x)dx = sin(x)+c$
 - $\int sec^{2}(x)dx = tan(x)+c$
 - $\int sec(x)tan(x)dx = sec(x)+c$
 - $\int csc^{2}(x)dx = -cot(x)+c$
 - $\int csc(x)cot(x)dx = -csc(x)+c$

### Integrals of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
$$\int\frac{1}{x^{2}+1}dx=tan^{-1}(x)$$
$$\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}dx=sin^{-1}(x)$$

### Integrals of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
 - $\int e^{x}dx = e^{x}+c$
 - $\int a^{x}dx = \frac{a^{x}}{ln(a)} + c$
 - $\int \frac{1}{x}dx=ln(x) + c$

## Substitution Rule
$$\int f(g(x))g'(x)dx = \int f(u)du$$
where $u=g(x)$
