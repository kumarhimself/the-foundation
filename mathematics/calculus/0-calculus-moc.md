# Calculus Details and Index
This folder contains the complete set of calculus notes and is based on *Paul's Online Notes*. These notes should not be used as the primary material for learning, but rather as a supplemental study tool.

The notes correspond to the first three calculus classes at the University of Wisconsin - Madison:
1. MATH 221 - Calculus I
2. MATH 222 - Calculus II
3. MATH 234 - Calculus III
