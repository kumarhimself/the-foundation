Dear Reader,

Welcome to the Foundation, a public vault consisting of notes from various subjects such as mathematics and literature. The goal of this Obsidian vault is to provide a comprehensive set of notes and to create an intricate web of ideas from different subjects and fields. 

The advantage of writing notes in markdown can be described in blank reasons:
1. Markdown is accessible everywhere and will be for the foreseeable future
2. Because all styling is done by pressing certain keys, you are able keep your hands on the keyboard for the majority of the note-taking process
3. Markdown does not have any default configurations, meaning you can enforce your own styles and file structures

The name of this vault is inspired by the premise of Isaac Asimov's book series, *The Foundation*, which tells the story of a man called Hari Seldon who predicts the fall of humanity through mathematical models. He gathers the galaxy's best scholars in various subjects and sets out to preserve the accumulated knowledge of humanity. There is so much more to the series, but that is the gist of it.

After doing a bit of research, I decided to follow the Maps of Contents (MOC) framework, which consists of creating table of contents for different subjects. The [[genesis-moc|Genesis MOC]] contains a list of fields and the subject MOCs. I also decided to use a special naming style for all of the files and folders called kebab casing in which all of the words are lowercase and connected by dashes instead of spaces.

Because this repository is public, you are allowed to use, reproduce, and edit my notes. All I ask is that you do not add anything inappropriate or take credit for my work.

Although you can read the notes on GitHub, some content won't display correctly. You can `git clone` or download the vault to your local machine and open it with the Obsidian note app (you will need git installed on your local machine to do this).

Here are the instructions for `cloning` the vault from GitHub:
1. Open your command-line interface
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/kumarhimself/the-foundation.git` in your preferred directory

When you want to update your local copy of the vault, follow these instructions:
1. Open your command-line interface
2. Go inside the `the-foundation` directory
3. Type `git pull origin main`

If you don't know how to use Git, I highly recommend you learn what it is and how to use it as it is an extremely useful tool and will no doubt have big implications in many industries. Here is the link to a great tutorial on YouTube: [Git Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE)

I hope you have a great experience reading my notes!

Sincerely,

Ayush Kumar
Creator of this Vault
