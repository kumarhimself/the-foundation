Dear Reader,

Hello there! My name is Ayush Kumar and this is my notes vault. This repository is public and you are allowed to use, reproduce, and edit my notes. All I ask is that you do not add anything inappropriate or take credit for my work.

Although you can read the notes on GitHub, some content won't display correctly. You can `git clone` or download the vault to your local machine and open it with the Obsidian note app (you will need git and a GitHub account to do this).

Here are the instructions for downloading the vault from GitHub:
1. Go to the repository dashboard
2. Click on the `Code` tab
3. Click on `Download Zip`
4. In your downloads folder, extract the zip folder and store the vault wherever you want
5. If you don't have Obsidian yet, download the software and open it
6. Click on `Open folder as Vault`

I hope you have a great experience reading my notes!

Sincerely,

Ayush Kumar
